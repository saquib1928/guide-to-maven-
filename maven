                                    SOME IMPORTANT POINTS 
                  
                  (1) There are two subdirectories of this structure: src and target.
                  (2) The src directory contains all of the source material for building the project, its site and so on.
                  (3) The src directory is the root directory of source code and test code.
                  (4) The main directory is the root directory for source code related to the application itself, not test code.
                  (5) The test directory contains the test source code.
                  (6) The java directories under main and test contains the Java code for the application itself which is under main and the Java code for the tests which is under test.
                  (7) The resources directory contains the resources needed by your project.
                  (8) The target directory is created by Maven. It contains all the compiled classes, JAR files etc.
                  (9) When executing the mvn clean command, Maven would clean the target directory.
                 (10) The webapp directory contains Java web application, if the project is a web application.
                 (11) The webapp directory is the root directory of the web application. The webapp directory contains the WEB-INF directory.
